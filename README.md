# Lab 3: Timers and Interrupts
In this repository you will find 3 folders with code, button interrupt, timer A blink, and
Button based delay.

## Button Interrupt
This code is an introduction to the interrupt service routinte and setting up interrupts and
flags to blink an LED via interrupt instead of polling

## Timer A Blink
This code uses the Timer A peripheral found in the MSP430 to blink an LED at a set rate.

## Button Based Delay
This code, if functioning properly, would have used a button to set the delay between
blinks of an LED based on how long the button was held down for. Unfortunately this 
code does not work properly.
